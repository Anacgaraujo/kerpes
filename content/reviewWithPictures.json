   "testimonialOne":"I love this place. This hidden gem is easily the best shop in the county...period. They have a great staff and they give fair value on trades which most shops don't. Prices are good and with regards to selection, if they don't have it, they can get it.",
   "customerTwo":"Tracy E.",
   "testimonialTwo":"Yesterday was out first visit into your store & I must say we were highly impressed. We left with ammo, accessories, & my husband got a DB 9mm. We were very impressed with your selection, helpfulness, & prices. So much so, that I stopped back today & purchased a Hi-point 40 cal. for my dad! You will be our shop for all of our gun needs going forward!",

   "testimonialThree":"Friendliest shop in the county! Always kind and extremely helpful!"
